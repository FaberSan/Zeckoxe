## Overview
Vultaik can be used to produce render layers for custom engines or next-gen games and provides building blocks for writing your own engine or game quickly.
Due to the parallel nature of GPUs, Vultaik can use [GPGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units) to exploit a GPU for computational tasks. Supports ComputePipeline and more, allowing to be used for general computations

## Low-level rendering backend

The rendering backend focuses entirely on Vulkan and HLSL, however, the API greatly simplifies the more painful points of writing straight Vulkan. Modern Vulkan [extensions](https://github.com/FaberSanZ/Vultaik/wiki/Extension) and [features](#Features) are aggressively made use of to improve performance

Some notable extensions that **should** be supported for optimal or correct behavior.
These extensions will likely become mandatory later.

- `VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing`
- `VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore`

- [ ] Shading rate
- [x] Descriptor indexing
- [ ] Timeline semaphore
- [ ] Synchronization2
- [x] Memory allocator
- [x] GPU-Assisted Validation
- [x] Compute Shader
- [x] Geometry Shader
- [x] Tessellation Shader
- [ ] Instancing, Indirect drawing
- [ ] Post-AA (FXAA, SMAA and TAA)
- [ ] Multithreaded rendering
- [x] Automatic descriptor set management
- [x] Shader reflection with [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross)
- [x] Vulkan HLSL for shaders, shaders are compiled in runtime with [DirectXShaderCompiler](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler)
- [x] GLTF 2.0 for samples

> The examples not only show how to use the API, but also show things specific to HLSL and its mapping with Vultaik, (Variable Rate Shading, [AMD effects](https://gpuopen.com/effects/), Ray Tracing) and can be used as a guide on how to use techniques independent of Vulkan.


## Examples


Example | Details
---------|--------
<img src="Screenshots/ClearScreen.PNG" width=380> | [Clear Screen](Src/Samples/Samples/ClearScreen/ClearScreen.cs)<br> This example shows how to configure the device and clear the color.
<img src="Screenshots/Triangle.PNG" width=380> | [Triangle](Src/Samples/Samples/Triangle/Triangle.cs)<br> This example shows how to render simple triangle.
<img src="Screenshots/Transformations.PNG" width=380> | [Transformations](Src/Samples/Samples/Transformations/Transformations.cs)<br> This example how to transform the world space for each object.
<img src="Screenshots/PushConstant.PNG" width=380> | [Push Constant](Src/Samples/Samples/PushConstant/PushConstant.cs)<br> This example use push constants, small blocks of uniform data stored within a command buffer, to pass data to a shader without the need for uniform buffers.
<img src="Screenshots/LoadGLTF.PNG" width=380> | [Load GLTF](Src/Samples/Samples/LoadGLTF/LoadGLTF.cs)<br> This example shows how to load GLTF models.
<img src="Screenshots/LoadTexture.PNG" width=380> | [Load Texture](Src/Samples/Samples/LoadTexture/LoadTexture.cs)<br> This example shows how to load 2D texture from disk (including all mip levels). 
<img src="Screenshots/Bindless.PNG" width=380> | [Bindless](Src/Samples/Samples/Bindless/Bindless.cs)<br> This example demonstrates the use of VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing for creating descriptor sets with a variable size that can be dynamically indexed in a shader using `SPV_EXT_descriptor_indexing`.
