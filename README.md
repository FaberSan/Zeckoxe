## Overview
Xultaik is an open-source C# game engine for realistic rendering. The engine is highly modular and aims at giving game makers more flexibility in their development.

<br>

## Low-level rendering backend

The rendering backend focuses entirely on DirectX 12, however, the API greatly simplifies the more painful points of writing straight DirectX 12.
