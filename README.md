  ##               Xultaik is a 2D/3D Game Engine implemented in [VulkanÂ®](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/)
  
</h1>

NOTE: The engine is being written from scratch and the previous project was obsolete and discarded

## Overview
Xultaik is an open-source C# game engine for realistic rendering. The engine is highly modular and aims at giving game makers more flexibility in their development.

<br>

## Low-level rendering backend

The rendering backend focuses entirely on Vulkan and HLSL, however, the API greatly simplifies the more painful points of writing straight Vulkan. Modern Vulkan [extensions](https://github.com/FaberSanZ/Vultaik/wiki/Extension) and [features](#Features) are aggressively made use of to improve performance
